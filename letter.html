          All that we cherish must fade into twilight, yet there are dreamers
          who dare to preserve. These fragments of brilliance, these echoes of
          light, these memories we choose to serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we stand, between yesterdays lost and tomorrows beyond our reach.
          Before dreams that paid too dear a cost, keeping vigil, too moved for
          speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold Rune, A tribute to what could have been, a window to an
          alternate present, where Zune's legacy lives on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is our reverence cast in digital form—a sanctuary of music born
          from the spirit of Zune. We dared to imagine the path not taken, to
          glimpse what might have blossomed, had those early dreams taken root.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here stands no child of modern convenience, untethered from clouds or
          streaming seas. Rather, it is a humble vessel, crafted to cradle your
          carefully curated collection of melodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within its understated heart beats an enlightened soul. Through
          algorithms that listen with a poet's ear, it weaves connections
          between kindred songs, creating tapestries of sound. Its sophisticated
          orchestration tools empower you to compose symphonies of moments, each
          playlist a story waiting to unfold.
        </p>
        <p>
          It carries echoes of beloved designs: Zune's timeless elegance,
          Windows Mobile's fluid grace, the luminescent touch of Reveal
          Highlight, and whispers of Windows 11's refined aesthetic—all flowing
          together in harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer this creation as both mirror and canvas. Every hue, every
          interface element, every feature awaits your personal touch. And like
          a gift to future dreamers, we've unveiled its essence through open
          source, inviting all to join in writing new chapters of this tale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision stretches across digital horizons, embracing Windows,
          macOS, and Linux alike—a bridge between distant shores.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the path proved longer than the stars first promised, we hold
          fast to our belief: that somewhere in tomorrow's dawn, there still
          lives a place where yesterday's dreams can bloom anew.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here stands our tribute to the past. A bridge to what could be, Where
          old dreams need not breathe their last.
        </p>
        <p>But live on, wild and free.</p>
